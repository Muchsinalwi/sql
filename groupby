The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

-- Without Group By

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers;

Output = error

-- With Group By

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

Output = the num of customerID will have a list in each country
